12.	Write two lists, one containing your first names and the other your second names. Join the two lists.

"""
# #1.Create a list with 5 items (names of people) and write a python program to output the 2nd item.
# names = ["Alec", "Athena", "Arita", "Arinda", "Anita"]
# print(names[1])

# #2.Write a python program to change the value of the first item to a new value
# names[0] = "Amanda"
# print(names)

# #3.Write a python program to add a sixth item to the list
# names.append("Athia")
# print(names)

# #4.Write a python program to add “Bathel” as the 3rd item in your list
# names.insert(2, "Bathel")
# print(names)

# #5.Write a python program to remove the 4th item from the list
# del names[3]
# print(names)

# #6.Use negative indexing to print the last item in your list
# print(names[-1])

# #7.Create a new list with 7 items and use a range of indexes to print the 3rd, 4th and 5th items.
# fruits = ["apples", "bananas", "guavas", "oranges", "grapes", "lemon", "jackfruit"]
# print(fruits[2:5])

# #8.	Write a list of countries and make a copy of it.
# countries = ["Australia", "Canada", "Brazil", "Korea", "China"]
# copy_countries = countries.copy()
# print(copy_countries)

# #9.Write a python program to loop through the list of countries
# for country in countries:
#     print(country)

# #10.Write a list of animal names and sort them in both descending and ascending order.
